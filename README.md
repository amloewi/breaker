# Breaker: An Emergency Mindfulness Minigame

Breaker is a small piece of software with a large ambition: to get you back on track when you're wasting time. It accomplishes this through a very elegant design ... and a very inelegant codebase.

## The Game

When you realize you're wasting time -- either staring at your screen blankly, or flipping constantly through tabs without actually reading any of them -- but for some reason *just can't stop* -- you need something to actively shake you out of it. However, the whole problem is the fact that you can't stop, so you need a *really* light-weight way to intervene. Instead of the hotkey for a new tab, just hit the hotkey for Breaker, and you enter -- **The Game**.
